# Changelog

All notable changes to PatchShuttle are recorded in this file. The project
uses semantic versioning, including Python-compatible pre-release versions.

## 0.1.0a2 - 2026-08-13

First release candidate prepared for external CI and TestPyPI qualification.

### Added

- Existing-project and empty-directory initialization with stable project IDs.
- Protocol 1 YAML jobs and equivalent immutable Python constructors.
- Bounded `audit`, transactional `patch`, and one-pass `verify` workflows.
- All v0.1 text actions, controlled Python, pytest, unittest, Django, import,
  and locally configured checks.
- Per-job backups, automatic rollback, guarded manual rollback, and explicit
  `--keep-changes` failure handling.
- Changed-Python-only isort followed by Black, with final check reruns.
- Workspace inventory comparison and unexpected side-effect reporting.
- Fixed-section timestamped logs, exact job archives, registry idempotency,
  project snapshots, and compact AI handoffs.
- Integration, end-to-end, wheel smoke, release validation, and index smoke
  tests.
- GitHub Actions workflows for the required Ubuntu and Windows matrix and for
  Trusted Publishing to TestPyPI and PyPI.

### Security

- Deny-by-default confirmation for patch and verify execution.
- Protected and ignored path policy, symbolic-link and special-file rejection,
  bounded inputs and outputs, non-shell subprocess execution, and best-effort
  log redaction.

### Qualification status

- Local Linux/Python 3.12 verification is complete.
- The GitHub-hosted compatibility matrix and TestPyPI installation remain
  external release gates and are not claimed as passed in this source tree.

## 0.1.0a1 - 2026-08-06

Internal development checkpoint containing the initial package scaffold,
typed job model, validation, workspace, path policy, planner, and early
transaction engine. It was not published as a supported release.
